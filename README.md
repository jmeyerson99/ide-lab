# ide-lab
IDE NXP Cup and Team Labs

## Usage
Each lab will have its own branch. Be sure you are working on the correct branch for the lab. As we approach the car, we can add more branches for version control tracking and speed experimentation.

There is a `code` directory. In here is all of the source code used.
Every other package contains a Keil project, but no code. All the code is added as an existing file from the `code` directory.

The reports are shared via Overleaf. Links to those projects can be added here later.

## Important Notes
ALWAYS PULL BEFORE MAKING CHANGES. Keep in touch so we know what needs changing and what doesn't.

## Coding Style
Doxygen style comments - will be formatted later, then follow those conventions.

All lines that exist for debugging have a `// DEBUG` comment placed after the line
All lines that are questionable or being skipped and must be returned to will be marked `// TODO - ` with a reason as to why it's incomplete
Any important info that is good to remember but doesn't apply to 1 specific line is marked with `// NOTE: `
