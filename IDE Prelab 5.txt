Prelab 5:

Enable clock for PDB0 module
	SIM_SCGC6 |= SIM_SCGC6_PDB_MASK;

Enable clock for PDB0 IRQ, use NVIC_EnableIRQ macro
	// Vector 68, IRQ 52, NVIC non-IPR register # 1, NVIC IPR register number 13
	NVIC_EnableIRQ(PDB0_IRQn);

Enable clock for the FTM0 module
	SIM_SCGC6 |= SIM_SCGC6_FTM0_MASK;

Enable the FTM0 IRQ, use NVIC_EnableIRQ macro
	NVIC_EnableIRQ(FTM0_IRQn);

Configure SW3 to be interrupted on the rising edge
	// Use PORTx_PCRn, bits 19-16
	PORTA_PCR4 |= PORT_PCR_IRQC(9); // 1001 = rising edge

Configure SW2 to be interrupted on both rising and falling edge
	// Use PORTx_PCRn, bits 19-16
	PORTC_PCR6 |= PORT_PCR_IRQC(11); // 1011 = either edge

Enable the clock for ADC1 module
	SIM_SCGC3 |= SIM_SCGC3_ADC1_MASK;

Enable the ADC1 IRQ, use NVIC_EnableIRQ macro
	NVIC_EnableIRQ(ADC1_IRQn);

Read result from ADC1
	unsigned short i = ADC1_RA >> 4;

Set DAC output value (12 bits) to variable i above (use DAC0, result is spread across 2 8 bit registers)
	DAC0_DAT0L = i & DAC_DATL_DATA0_MASK;        // DAC0_DATnL
	DAC0_DAT0H = (i >> 8) & DAC_DATH_DATA1_MASK; // DAC0_DATnH


lab report notes:
	know the goal of the lab - discover static (DC part) and dynamic (AC part) characteristics of OPB745
	what exactly does that transducer do? (light to current)
	be sure to explain your expectations before saying "the results matched the expectations"
	don't say it was a success without explaining why it was successful
	put diagrams for test setup
	farther vs further (farther you measure with a ruler)

	references section - cite document name
	Q2 - no current flows at 0, so it acts as an open circuit connected high to Vs
	put graphs from datasheet in report
